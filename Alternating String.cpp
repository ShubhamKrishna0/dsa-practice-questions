/*
To solve this problem, we need to transform a string into an "alternating string" as defined in the problem:

The characters at even indices must be the same.
The characters at odd indices must be the same.
The length of the string must be even.
Approach:
1. Handling Single-Character Strings:
If the string has only one character (n=1), it's impossible to have an alternating string of even length. Therefore, we need to delete the character, and the answer for such cases is 1 operation.

2. Check for Even-Length Strings:
If the string's length is already even, then the goal is to check whether the characters at even and odd positions match their respective patterns.

Create two sets of characters:
One set for characters at even indices (s[0], s[2], s[4], ...)
One set for characters at odd indices (s[1], s[3], s[5], ...)
Operations for Even Length:

If there are multiple distinct characters in the even or odd positions, we will have to make replacements to make all characters in those positions the same.
Count the number of positions that donâ€™t match the alternating pattern, and these mismatches are the number of replacements required.
3. Handling Odd-Length Strings:
If the string's length is odd, it's impossible to make the string alternating while maintaining the same length. We can either:
Delete one character to make the length even.
Follow the same process as for even-length strings to check the remaining part after the deletion.
Thus, in case of odd-length strings, the optimal approach is:

Either delete one character (typically the last one).
After that, proceed to check the remaining even-length string as described for the even case.
Steps to Implement:
Loop over the number of test cases.
For each test case:
If the string has length 1, the answer is 1 (since deleting the character is the only solution).
If the string has an odd length:
Consider deleting a character to make the length even.
For even-length strings:
Count how many characters need to be replaced at the even and odd indices to make all even-indexed characters the same and all odd-indexed characters the same.
Output the minimum number of operations required.
